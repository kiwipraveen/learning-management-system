Project Title:
Learning Management System (LMS)

Overview:
The LMS project is a web-based platform designed to provide a robust solution for managing and delivering online courses, including functionalities for user management, course creation, progress tracking, and payment processing. The architecture leverages the microservices model to ensure scalability, modularity, and maintainability.

Backend:
The backend follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

API Gateway:

Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.

Handles routing of requests to appropriate microservices.

Implements security, such as authentication and authorization.

Microservices:

Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain, ensuring modularity and scalability:

User Service: Handles user registration, authentication, roles (student/instructor), and profile management.

Course Service: Manages course creation, updates, deletion, categories, and modules.

Enrollment Service: Tracks user enrollments and manages progress.

Payment Service: Facilitates payment processing, invoicing, and refunds.

Notification Service: Sends notifications, such as email or SMS, to users regarding course updates or reminders.

Communication:

Intercommunication between microservices: REST API calls using RestTemplate.

Service discovery is managed via Eureka Server, enabling dynamic resolution of services in a distributed system.

Configuration Management:

Centralized configuration management through Config Server for consistent settings across all microservices.

Database:

Each microservice has its own dedicated database (database-per-service model) for data isolation and optimized performance.

Example: User Service uses a relational database like MySQL, whereas Course Service might use NoSQL for course data.

Frontend:
Developed using React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience. Key aspects include:

Features:

User Authentication: Login/Signup functionalities.

Dashboard: Personalized dashboards for students and instructors.

Course Management: Browsing, searching, and filtering courses.

Video Playback: Video lectures with progress tracking.

Payment Interface: Smooth checkout experience with payment integration.

Responsive UI: Optimized for various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

API Integration:

Communicates with the backend API Gateway to retrieve and send data via RESTful APIs.

Implements state management using libraries like Redux or Context API.

Styling:

Styled using CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, or Bootstrap for a polished and professional look.
